BUGS-
when starting a new save, day timer says "complete the tutorial first", it should be hidden completely
crop ui panel is placeholder
tutorial text needs background panel
tutorial explicitly mentions keybinds
tutorial still doesnt work for harvesting minigame
do you want to sleep menu is placeholder
scythe is called harvesting tool
farm plot issue still exists (randomly gain more, error in consoole)
